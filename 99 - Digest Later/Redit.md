An open-source, in-memory data store. It is famous for being incredibly fast.

- **The Problem it Solves:** Traditional databases (like SQL) are stored on hard drives (disk). Reading from disk is slow.
- **The Solution:** Redis stores data in **RAM** (memory). This makes read/write operations microsecond-fast.
- **Common Uses:**
    - **Caching:** Storing frequently accessed data so you don't have to hit the slow database.
    - **Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe):** A messaging system where one part of an app "publishes" a message, and other parts "subscribe" to receive it instantly.

### Why are they used together? (The Redis Backplane)

This is the most common reason you see them mentioned in the same sentence.

When your application becomes popular, one server isn't enough to handle all the users. You have to add more servers (this is called **Horizontal Scaling**).

**The Problem:** Imagine you have **Server A** and **Server B**.

- User 1 connects to **Server A**.
    
- User 2 connects to **Server B**.
    
- If User 1 sends a chat message, **Server A** has it. **Server A** tries to broadcast it to all users, but it doesn't know User 2 exists (because User 2 is on Server B). User 2 never gets the message.
    

**The Solution (Redis Backplane):** You use Redis as a "middleman" (Backplane).

1. User 1 sends a message to **Server A**.
    
2. **Server A** sends the message to **Redis**.
    
3. **Redis** shouts the message to **ALL servers** (Server A and Server B) using its Pub/Sub feature.
    
4. **Server B** hears the message from Redis and pushes it to User 2.
