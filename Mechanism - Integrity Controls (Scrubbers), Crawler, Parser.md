**Alt Names**
- Semantic Enforcement Control
- Integrity Sync
- Lifecycle State Reconcile
- Enforce semantic guardrails

Short answer: **ontologically, it is not “the job” or “the procedure.”**  
Those are _execution forms_.  
The **thing itself** is a **semantic control capability**.

Below is the clean mental model, then the **most resonant name**.

---

## What _is_ it, really?

### Level‑set by abstraction layer

|Layer|What it is|What it is **not**|
|---|---|---|
|**Conceptual / Semantic**|**A semantic enforcement control**|Not a job|
|**Logical / System**|A **deterministic reconciliation rule set**|Not a single function|
|**Physical / Execution**|Implemented as job / procedure / function|Not the identity|

So:

- **Job** → _how often_ it runs
- **Procedure / Function** → _how it is executed_
- **Tool** → _deployment packaging_

Those are **delivery mechanisms**.

The identity you want executives, auditors, and architects to recognize is:

> **A semantic integrity control over operational data**

---

## Why “job / procedure / tool” are weak names

From an executive + analytics governance lens:

- **Job** → scheduling artifact (non-strategic)
- **Procedure** → implementation detail (DB‑local)
- **Tool** → vendor-ish, disposable, unclear ownership
- **Cleanup** → implies subjective rewriting of truth (dangerous)

None of those signal:

- governance
- financial correctness
- audit defensibility
- semantic intent

---

## The correct noun category

The most resonant category is:

> **Assurance / Integrity / Control**

This places it alongside:

- financial controls
- SOX assertions
- reporting guarantees
- semantic governance

---

## The strongest single name (recommended)

### ✅ **SemanticIntegrityControl**

**Why this wins**

- **Semantic** → not cosmetic, not ETL hygiene
- **Integrity** → finance, audit, executive language
- **Control** → governance, not manipulation

**How it manifests**

- _SemanticIntegrityControl.Job_
- _SemanticIntegrityControl.Procedure_
- _SemanticIntegrityControl.RuleSet_

Executives talk about the **control**.  
Engineers schedule the **job**.

---

## Strong alternatives (ranked)

### Governance / Executive‑grade

1. **ReportingIntegrityControl**  
    _Signals finance-grade reporting trust._
    
2. **AnalyticsIntegrityAssurance**  
    _Very strong with CFO / FP&A._
    
3. **AuditGradeSemanticControl**  
    _Maximizes defensibility and traceability._
    

---

### Semantic / Architecture‑grade

4. **OperationalStateIntegrityControl**  
    _Explicitly scoped to lifecycle/state._
    
5. **SemanticStateReconciliationControl**  
    _More technical, still defensible._
    

---

### What I would **not** choose as the primary name

- `Reconciler` → sounds ad‑hoc
- `Normalizer` → sounds lossy
- `Guardrail` → vague, policy‑ish
- `Cleaner / Fixer / Scrubber` → analytically dangerous language

These may exist as **internal components**, not the headline concept.

---

## Final recommendation (canonical)

**Name the thing:**

> **SemanticIntegrityControl**

**Document it as:**

> _A deterministic semantic control that enforces analytic correctness by reconciling system‑valid but epistemically false operational states prior to metric evaluation._

**Implement it as:**

- a nightly job
- invoking procedures
- applying rule sets

But never let _execution_ define _identity_.

If you want next:

- a **1‑paragraph control policy** (SOX‑aligned)
- a **metric card dependency declaration**
- or a **DAG showing assertion vs correction vs provenance**

Say the word.

### Notes (clinical, minimal)

- If you want **maximum executive resonance**, the strongest cluster is:  
    **ReportingFidelityAssurance**, **KPIIntegrityAssuranceJob**, **SemanticIntegrityGuard**, **AuditGradeRecordAssurance**.
- If you want **maximum system-agnostic + low collision**, the strongest cluster is:  
    **StateReconciliationJob**, **CanonicalStateNormalizer**, **SemanticGuardrailProcedure**, **OperationalStateGovernor**.

### Quick follow-up (to converge on a final pick)

Which framing do you want the name to privilege most?

1. **Finance/audit optics** (assurance, fidelity, audit-grade)
2. **Data governance optics** (integrity, guardrails, control)
3. **Engineering optics** (reconciler, normalizer, canonicalizer)

## Derived State Materialization Pattern
A state resolution (or state derivation) process that produces a canonical patient status from cross‑domain signals.

- operational facts → evaluated
- authoritative state → materialized
- downstream reporting becomes deterministic

To be precise:

- ❌ not just “data cleanup”
- ❌ not ETL hygiene
- ❌ not normalization
- ❌ not validation
- ❌ business rule evaluation → too generic, doesn’t imply finality.

# Other Names

### **State Resolution**

> A process that evaluates multiple signals to determine a single authoritative state of an entity.

This is the cleanest, most abstract classification.

### Lifecycle Resolution
### **Canonicalization**
Used in data/analytics contexts.

> Converting messy or ambiguous representations into one **canonical state**.


### **Disposition Determination**

Common in healthcare / operations. Focuses on outcome status.

### **State Derivation**

Used when the state is **not stored directly** but computed from rules.

> Example: Patient “Active” is derived from multiple conditions rather than entered.

---

### **State Reconciliation**

Used when **multiple systems or perspectives disagree** and must be aligned.

> Common in finance, identity, MDM, healthcare.
