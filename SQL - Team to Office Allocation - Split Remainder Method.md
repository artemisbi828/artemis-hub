- quotient + 1 


`Split + Remainder Method`: Use RN to create tie breaker row, give +1 until no remainder remains
1. zero handling pattern = 0 
2. calculate rn.seq_office per team vs total_office_qty per team
3. calculate modulo remainder (10 goal % 6 offices = 4 remainder)
4. give each office `quotient + 1` 

5. if RN <= reaminder, then give 1 (overflow)
6. 
7. divide evenly via modulo (%)
8. create RN --> line up offices and give ticket
9. calc division + remainder
10. compare RN vs remainder (ticket queue vs stock available) --> if RN <= remainder --> give 1, else 0 (out-of-stock)

-- 5.0 / 3 = 1.666 -->
