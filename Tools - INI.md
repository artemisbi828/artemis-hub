## 1. Why it is INI (Specifically, Git Config)

The syntax closely matches the historical and widespread INI (Initialization) file format, which Git uses for its configuration.

- **Structure:** INI files use square brackets (`[]`) to denote **sections**, and key/value pairs (`key = value`) are defined beneath them. This structure is shared with TOML, which is why the confusion exists.
- **Unique Feature (The Key Difference):** The format allows keys (like `path`) to be associated directly with the section header (like `includeIf "gitdir:..."`), which is **not valid in TOML**.
    - In INI/Git config, the text within the brackets can include spaces and colon separators (e.g., `includeIf "..."`) which defines the entire section header.
        

## 2. Why it is **NOT** TOML

TOML has strict rules about how keys and values are defined, which your snippet violates:

- **TOML Requires Simple Keys in Brackets:** In TOML, anything inside the brackets (`[]`) must be a clean, valid table name. It cannot be a complex key/value definition or contain complex characters like quotation marks and colons for filtering.
    - **Invalid TOML:** `[includeIf "gitdir:C:/..."]`
    - **Valid TOML Table:** `[settings]` or `[environments.dev]`
- **TOML Syntax for Conditional/Profile Data:** As discussed earlier, TOML doesn't have a native `includeIf` directive. You would have to structure your TOML like this and have the application read the correct block:

    Ini, TOML

    ```
    # This would be the TOML approach
    [[includeIf]]
    condition = "gitdir:C:/vsWorkspace/projects_p/"
    path = ".gitconfig-personal"
    
    [[includeIf]]
    condition = "gitdir:C:/vsWorkspace/projects_sd/"
    path = ".gitconfig-work"
    ```

## 3. Comparison of INI and TOML Syntax

TOML was created partially to be a more robust successor to INI.

|**Feature**|**INI Syntax (e.g., Git Config)**|**TOML Syntax**|
|---|---|---|
|**Section/Table**|`[section]`|`[table]`|
|**Key-Value**|`key = value`|`key = "value"`|
|**Arrays**|No native support; requires hacks like multiple `key = value` lines.|`array = [1, 2, 3]` (Native support)|
|**Data Types**|Everything is a string; interpretation is left to the application.|Strong native support for Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans, Dates, and Times.|
|**Nesting**|Achieved by dotted keys (e.g., `section.key = value`) or using the section header itself.|Achieved by dotted tables: `[section.subsection]` or `[array_of_tables]`|

**Conclusion:** The snippet you shared is a classic example of **INI-style configuration**, specifically how **Git** implements its powerful **conditional includes** (`includeIf`).
