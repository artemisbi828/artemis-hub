**Quick Answer:** Parquet is a **columnar, compressed, schema-aware format** designed for big data analytics, while CSV is a **row-based, plain text format** that’s human-readable and universally compatible. Parquet is faster and more efficient for large datasets, whereas CSV is simpler and more portable.

## 📊 Key Differences Between Parquet and CSV

| Feature               | **Parquet**                                           | **CSV**                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage Structure** | Columnar (data stored by column)                      | Row-based (data stored line by line)                |
| **Compression**       | Built-in, highly efficient (Snappy, Gzip, Zstandard)  | Limited; usually external compression (zip/gzip)    |
| **Schema**            | Embedded schema defines data types and structure      | No schema; everything is text, types inferred later |
| **Performance**       | Faster queries (reads only needed columns)            | Slower queries (must read entire rows)              |
| **File Size**         | Much smaller due to compression and encoding          | Larger, especially for wide tables                  |
| **Data Types**        | Supports complex/nested types                         | Flat text only                                      |
| **Human Readability** | Not human-readable (binary format)                    | Human-readable (open in any text editor)            |
| **Compatibility**     | Best with big data tools (Spark, Hive, Arrow, Fabric) | Universally supported (Excel, Python, R, SQL)       |

## 🔎 Why Parquet is Better for Large Tables

- **Columnar storage** means queries that only need a few columns don’t waste time scanning the rest.
- **Compression** reduces storage costs and speeds up transfers.
- **Predicate pushdown** allows skipping irrelevant data during reads.
- **Schema enforcement** ensures data consistency and reduces errors.

For example, if you have a 12M-row table with 50 columns but only query 3 columns, Parquet will read just those 3, while CSV must scan all 50.

## ⚖️ Why CSV Still Matters

- **Portability:** CSV can be opened anywhere — Excel, Notepad, Python, R.
- **Simplicity:** Easy to generate and inspect manually.
- **Interoperability:** Works across systems without specialized libraries.

CSV is great for **small datasets, quick sharing, or human inspection**. But for **analytics, machine learning, or large-scale storage**, Parquet is far superior.

## 🧠 Practical Guidance

- **Use Parquet** when working with Fabric, Spark, or any big data pipeline. It’s the modern standard for scalable analytics.
- **Use CSV** when sharing small extracts with colleagues, exporting to Excel, or needing human readability.
- **Hybrid approach:** Store master datasets in Parquet, but export filtered subsets to CSV for convenience.

✅ **Summary:** Parquet is optimized for performance, compression, and analytics at scale. CSV is simple, universal, and human-readable. For your 12M-row Fabric table, **Parquet is the right choice** — CSV will be too large and inefficient.
